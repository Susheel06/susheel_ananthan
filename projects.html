      <h5>RASA based NLU Chat bot - April, 2020</h5>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Built a restaurant chatbot using RASA (NLU framework) where based on user intent, the bot
            returns top 5 rated restaurant list based on the cuisine and location chosen by the user.
          </li>
          <li>Trained our model to extract cuisine, location intent from the user statement. Used Bing map API
            to
            extract location id. Further with location id and cuisine, using Zomato
            API we returned top 5 restaurants.
          </li>

      <h5>Smart Irrigation - April, 2020</h5>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>This project incorporates cloud based smart irrigation where the
            micro-controller actuates desired control action on the water pump based on data transmitted from the field
            transmitters and weather API.
          </li>
          <li>The flow of information between the micro-controller and the cloud is supported by stable network
            services such as LoRaWAN or Sigfox. Parallelly data from weather API is taken to know possibility
            of rain to avoid irrigation on that day.
          </li>
          <li>The project also incorporates Human Machine Interface(HMI) to monitor data such as moisture content in
            soil, level/volume of water present in reservoir and other related
            parameters, to pre-set threshold value of desired parameters to be maintained, also an option of automatic
            mode and manual mode of operation.
